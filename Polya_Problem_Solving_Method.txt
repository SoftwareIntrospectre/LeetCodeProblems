Method from G. Polya's book: "How to Solve It (2nd Edition)"


1. Understanding the Problem
    A. What is the Unknown?
    B. What are the data?
    C. What is the Condition?
    D. Is it possible to satisfy the condition?
        D1. Is it insufficient?
        D2. Is it redundant?
        D3. Is it contradictory?

    E. Draw a figure (i.e.: make a model / example)
    F. Separate various parts of the condition (write them down)

2. Devising a Plan
    A. Familiarity with the problem
        A1. Have you seen it before? 
        A2. If not: have you seen the same problem in a slightly different form?
    
    B. Do you know a related problem?
        B1. Do you know of a provable method that can be useful?

    C. Look at the Unknown
        C1. Do you know of a problem with a similar Unknown?
            C1a. If so: Could you use the result here?
            C1b. If so: Could you use the method here?
                C1bi. If so: Should you introduce an extra element to that method make it work?

    D. Could you restate the problem?
        D1. If so: Could you still restate it differently?
    
    E. Could you imagine a more accessible problem?
        E1. If not: Could you imagine a more general problem?
        E2. If not: Could you imagine a more specialized problem?
        E3. If not: Could you imagine a more analagous problem? (i.e. analogy for comparison)
    
    F. Could you solve part of the problem?
        F1. Can you keep only part of the condition?
            F1a. Can you drop the other part of the condition?
                Fi. 1aCan you determine how much of the unknown is left after that?
        
    G. Could you derive something useful from the data?
        G1. Could you think of other data appropriate to determine the unknown?
        G2. Could you change the unknown or the data, or both if necessary, so that the new unknown and the new data are nearer to each other?
        
    H. Did you use all of the data?
    
    I. Did you use the whole condition?

    J. Have you taken into account all essential notations involved in the problem?


3. Carrying Out the Plan
    A. Check each Step.
        A1. Can you see clearly that the step is correct?
            A1a. Can you prove that it is correct?

4. Looking Back
    A. Can you check the result?
    B. Can you check the argument?
    C. Can you derive the result differently?
        C1. Can you see it at a glance?

    D. Can you use the result, or method, for some other problem?
