# LeetCodeProblems
Roadmap of building LeetCode skill through curated list of problems. Meant to track my progress.


This is based on NeetCode's roadmap on this. The idea is to start simple, and have foundational knowledge
build upon itself to solve more complex problems.

https://neetcode.io/roadmap 

Problems are divied into 18 categories. Each will have its own subset of problems, with multiple attempts.

01	Arrays & Hashing
02	Stack
03	Two Pointers
04	Binary Search
05	Sliding Window
06	Linked List
07	Trees
08	Tries
09	Backtracking
10	Graphs
11	Heap/Priority Queue
12	Advanced Graphs
13	Intervals
14	Greedy
15	1-Dimensional Dynamic Programming
16	2-Dimensional Dynamic Programming
17	Bit Manipulation
18	Math & Geometry

The goal is not to memorize problems, but to understand the essence of what each type of problem there is to solve, and internalize those patterns. Programming weight training.
