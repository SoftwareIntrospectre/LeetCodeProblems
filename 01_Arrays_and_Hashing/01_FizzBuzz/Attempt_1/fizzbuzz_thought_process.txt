This problem is about handling edge cases, and handling them with different logic as I go.

Since it can be the case that 15 meets both 3 and 5 conditions, I'm prioritizing that first (FizzBuzz).
Next is conditions 3 and 5, which are Fizz and Buzz respectively.

Last is when none of those conditions are met, return the number as a string.

The result is a list of strings, in the order from 1 to n.
