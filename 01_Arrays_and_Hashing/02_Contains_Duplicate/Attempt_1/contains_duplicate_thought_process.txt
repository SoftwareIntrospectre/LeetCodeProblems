This problem is about handling edge cases, and iterating through an array.

If it's a list (array) of integers, and all I need to do is check to see if it's a duplicate: then sorting it first would be simplest.

That way the earliest possible moment a duplicate appears, it can be returned as true the moment it happens. Otherwise will return false.

This has the weakness of being O(n) in the event the last element is the same as the 2nd to last element, but going with this approach for Attempt 1.
